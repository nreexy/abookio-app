<h1>Privacy Policy for Abookio</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>
<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Tristan Heine</p>
<p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@abookio.com">support@abookio.com</a></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Abookio (“we,” “our,” “us”) is a privacy-first audiobook player. This Privacy Policy explains how Abookio handles your information. Abookio does not collect, track, or share any personal information with the developer or any third party. All user data remains on your device or, if you enable iCloud Sync, in your personal iCloud account.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Do <strong>Not</strong> Collect</h2>
<p>
Abookio does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.
We have no access to your files, playback activity, metadata, or any other personal information.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
<p>
To provide its functionality, Abookio stores limited information locally on your device:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Audiobook metadata (title, author, cover)</li>
  <li>Playback progress</li>
  <li>Bookmarks and notes</li>
  <li>Collections and wishlists</li>
  <li>User-created book ratings</li>
</ul>
<p>
All of this data remains on your device unless you enable iCloud Sync.
You can delete it at any time using the in-app “Delete All Data” option or by deleting the app.
</p>

<h2>4. iCloud Sync</h2>
<p>
If you enable iCloud Sync, Abookio may store the following data in your private iCloud account:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Audiobook metadata, playback progress, bookmarks, and collections</li>
  <li>A list of connected cloud accounts and encrypted access tokens</li>
</ul>
<p>
iCloud operations are handled exclusively by Apple’s CloudKit and iCloud Keychain services.
Data stored in iCloud is end-to-end encrypted, and neither Abookio nor the developer can access it.
</p>

<h2>5. Cloud Provider Connections</h2>

<h3>Official Cloud Providers</h3>
<p>
Abookio includes built-in support for <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Dropbox</strong>, and <strong>OneDrive</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can add these accounts from a list in <strong>Settings → Add Account</strong>.</li>
  <li>Each connection uses the provider’s official OAuth login flow.</li>
  <li>The app requests read-only access to files and never uploads, edits, or deletes content.</li>
  <li>OAuth tokens are stored locally in the iOS Keychain or, if iCloud Sync is enabled, in iCloud Keychain (end-to-end encrypted).</li>
  <li>No credentials or user data are sent to the developer or any external server.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Custom Providers</h3>
<p>
Abookio also supports connecting additional, user-defined file providers.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users manually enter the provider’s website URL and their personal API key.</li>
  <li>The app checks locally whether the entered service is supported.</li>
  <li>If supported, the account is added with read-only access to allow playback of user-owned files.</li>
  <li>If not supported, the app displays “Host not supported.”</li>
  <li>All URLs and API keys are stored encrypted in the iOS Keychain, and, when iCloud Sync is enabled, in iCloud Keychain.</li>
  <li>No credentials or access information ever leave the user’s device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. iTunes Search and Apple Books Integration</h2>
<p>
Abookio uses Apple’s iTunes Search API to display audiobook metadata, previews, and purchase links.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All metadata and previews are fetched directly from Apple’s servers.</li>
  <li>Users may add search results to a wishlist and play official Apple-provided samples.</li>
  <li>The “View in Apple Books” button opens the Apple Books app or App Store page for legal purchase.</li>
  <li>Abookio does not sell content or process payments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
Abookio offers an optional Pro subscription that unlocks cloud integrations and iCloud Sync.
All transactions are handled solely by Apple’s App Store.
Abookio does not process or store payment or subscription information.
The app only verifies whether a valid subscription exists locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>8. Support Contact</h2>
<p>
If you contact us at <a href="mailto:support@abookio.com">support@abookio.com</a>, your message and email address are used only to respond to your inquiry.
Messages are retained for up to 12 months and then deleted automatically.
We do not collect additional personal information or share correspondence data.
</p>

<h2>9. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>
All data remains on your device or in your iCloud account.
Deleting the app or using the “Delete All Data” feature removes local data.
You may disable iCloud Sync at any time in your device settings, which also deletes synced data from iCloud.
</p>

<h2>10. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Abookio relies on iOS and iCloud security technologies:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All credentials and tokens are stored encrypted in the Keychain.</li>
  <li>Network communication uses secure HTTPS/TLS connections.</li>
  <li>No unencrypted personal data ever leaves your device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. Third-Party Responsibility</h2>
<p>
Abookio integrates with third-party services only when you choose to connect them.
Each service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or a custom provider) has its own privacy policy and terms.
Abookio is not responsible for third-party data practices.
You are responsible for ensuring you have rights to all content accessed through those accounts.
</p>

<h2>12. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
<p>
Where Abookio processes limited data (such as iCloud Sync or provider connections),
the legal basis under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is Article 6(1)(b) —
processing necessary for the performance of a contract, as these actions are required to deliver app functionality.
</p>

<h2>13. Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
<p>
Under applicable data protection laws, you may:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access, correct, or delete data stored in iCloud or on your device.</li>
  <li>Withdraw consent for iCloud Sync via your device settings.</li>
  <li>Manage or delete data linked to your Apple ID through Apple’s privacy tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Abookio itself does not hold or control any user data outside Apple’s ecosystem.
</p>

<h2>14. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Abookio is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or higher minimum age where applicable).
</p>

<h2>15. International Use</h2>
<p>
Abookio is developed in Germany and complies with the EU GDPR.
Since no personal data is transmitted to external servers, there are no international data transfers by the developer.
</p>

<h2>16. Updates to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect app or legal changes.
The latest version will always be available within the app and on our official website.
Significant updates will be announced within the app before they take effect.
</p>
