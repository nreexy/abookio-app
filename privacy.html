  <h1>Abookio Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong>26 October 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Abookio is a privacy-first audiobook player that allows you to listen to your personal audiobook collection from local files or your own cloud storage. We do not collect, share, or sell personal data.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>Abookio does not collect or transmit any personal data, usage analytics, or identifiers to external servers or third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Your audiobook metadata, playback progress, bookmarks, notes, and collections are stored locally on your device and never sent to our servers. This data remains private to you.</p>

  <h2>4. iCloud Sync</h2>
  <p>If you enable iCloud Sync (Abookio Pro feature), your audiobook metadata, progress, bookmarks, and notes are synced securely via Apple’s iCloud using end-to-end encryption. No other servers have access to this data.</p>

  <h2>5. Cloud Provider Connections</h2>
  <p>Abookio Pro users can connect their own cloud storage providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, or custom providers using a URL and API key). Connections use read-only access and are authenticated directly with the provider’s official login flow or user-provided credentials. Abookio does not have access to or store your cloud files.</p>

  <h2>6. Purchases</h2>
  <p>Abookio Pro is available as a one-time in-app purchase through the Apple App Store. All purchase processing is handled by Apple, and Abookio does not store payment or user account information.</p>

  <h2>7. Email Communication</h2>
  <p>If you contact us via email at <a href="mailto:support@abookio.com">support@abookio.com</a>, your message and address are retained for up to 12 months for support purposes and then deleted automatically.</p>

  <h2>8. User Rights</h2>
  <p>You can delete all local and iCloud-synced data at any time from within the app. No data remains on our systems, as we do not operate any user data servers.</p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Abookio is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
  <p>For any privacy-related questions, contact:
