  <h1>Abookio Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 5, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of Abookio (the “App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. About Abookio</h2>
  <p>Abookio is a privacy-first audiobook player for iOS that lets you listen to personally owned audiobook files stored locally or in your connected cloud accounts. The App does not host or distribute content and does not operate developer-managed servers for user data.</p>

  <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use the App. If you are under the age required to consent to data processing in your country, you must have parental or guardian permission.</p>

  <h2>4. License</h2>
  <p>Subject to these Terms, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App on iOS devices you own or control. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App, nor reverse engineer it except as permitted by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Content & Responsibility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are solely responsible for the content you access, store, or play through the App.</li>
    <li>You represent that you own or have the legal rights to all audiobook files you access via the App.</li>
    <li>The App does not verify ownership or licensing of files.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Cloud Providers & Custom Connections</h2>
  <p>Pro users may connect third-party services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) via official OAuth flows or connect custom providers by entering a service URL and API key. Connections are read-only; the App does not upload, edit, or delete files.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access tokens are stored on-device (and may sync via iCloud Keychain if enabled by the user).</li>
    <li>Third-party services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. The developer is not responsible for their availability, security, or content.</li>
    <li>Custom provider support is subject to local capability checks; unsupported hosts cannot be added.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Metadata & Public Sources</h2>
  <p>The App may retrieve publicly available metadata (e.g., titles, authors) from sources such as Google Books API and Apple’s iTunes Store Search API to organize your library. The App does not submit personal data with these requests.</p>

  <h2>8. Barcode Scanning</h2>
  <p>You may add books by scanning a barcode with your device camera. Camera input is processed on-device and not stored by the developer. The scanned value may be used to fetch public metadata from Google Books and iTunes Search.</p>

  <h2>9. Apple Intelligence (On-Device)</h2>
  <p>Optional Apple Intelligence features may analyze audiobook descriptions <em>on device</em> to extract organizational details (e.g., primary location, sorting keywords). No analysis leaves the device; results may be stored locally and may sync to your iCloud if enabled.</p>

  <h2>10. iCloud Sync</h2>
  <p>If enabled, certain metadata (e.g., progress, bookmarks, notes) may sync via Apple’s iCloud/CloudKit and iCloud Keychain under Apple’s terms. The developer cannot access iCloud-stored data.</p>

  <h2>11. Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Abookio Pro is offered via Apple’s in-app purchase system. Billing, renewals, cancellations, and refunds are handled by Apple under App Store terms. Pro unlocks cloud integrations and iCloud sync; core local playback functionality remains available without Pro.</p>

  <h2>12. Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is designed to minimize data collection. For details, see our <a href="https://abookio.app/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms.</p>

  <h2>13. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use the App to infringe copyrights or other rights.</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to access accounts or content you do not own or have rights to.</li>
    <li>Do not misuse integrations or attempt to bypass technical restrictions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>14. Availability & Changes</h2>
  <p>Features may change, be suspended, or discontinued at any time. Third-party integrations may break or change due to provider API updates, outages, or policy changes. We may update the App and these Terms from time to time. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

  <h2>15. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>

  <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, CONTENT, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE APP OR PRO FEATURES IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

  <h2>17. Termination</h2>
  <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access to the App if you materially breach these Terms or use the App unlawfully. Upon termination, your license ends and you must cease use of the App.</p>

  <h2>18. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Germany, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. Mandatory consumer protection rules of your country of residence may also apply.</p>

  <h2>19. Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>

  <h2>20. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms, together with the <a href="https://abookio.app/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire agreement between you and the developer regarding the App.</p>
