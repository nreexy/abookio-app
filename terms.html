  <h1>Abookio Terms of Service / End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 5, 2025<br/>
  <strong>Developer:</strong> Tristan Heine, Germany — see <a href="https://abookio.app/impressum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Impressum</a> for full contact details.<br/>
  <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@abookio.com">support@abookio.com</a></p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Abookio (the “App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. About Abookio</h2>
  <p>Abookio is a privacy-first audiobook player for iOS that lets you listen to personally owned audiobook files stored locally or in your connected cloud accounts. The App does not host or distribute content and does not operate developer-managed servers for user content.</p>

  <h2>3. Acknowledgement — Relationship with Apple</h2>
  <p>This EULA is concluded between you and the developer, not Apple. Apple is not responsible for the App, its content, or its operation. Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services for the App.</p>
  <p class="section-note">If the App fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App (if applicable). To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple will have no other warranty obligations with respect to the App.</p>
  <p>You and the developer acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this EULA, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right to enforce this EULA against you as a third-party beneficiary.</p>

  <h2>4. Scope of License</h2>
  <p>Subject to these Terms, the developer grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App on Apple-branded devices you own or control, and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. This license may extend to accounts associated with you through Family Sharing or volume purchasing. The App is licensed, not sold.</p>

  <h2>5. Maintenance and Support</h2>
  <p>The developer is solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services for the App, if any. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support services with respect to the App.</p>

  <h2>6. Warranty</h2>
  <p>The developer is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied and to the extent not effectively disclaimed. The App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" except as otherwise required by applicable law. In the event of a failure of the App to conform to any limited warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App (if applicable). To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple will have no other warranty obligations.</p>

  <h2>7. Product Claims</h2>
  <p>The developer, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession or use of the App, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>product liability claims;</li>
    <li>claims that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and</li>
    <li>claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The EULA does not (and may not) limit the developer's liability to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>8. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
  <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to the App, including associated intellectual property rights, are owned by the developer or licensors. In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your use of the App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, the developer, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of such claim.</p>

  <h2>9. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use the App. If you are under the age required to consent to data processing in your country, you must have parental or guardian permission to use the App.</p>

  <h2>10. Your Content & Responsibility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are solely responsible for the content you access, store, or play through the App.</li>
    <li>You represent and warrant that you own or have the legal right to use all audiobook files you access via the App.</li>
    <li>The App does not monitor, validate, or certify ownership or licensing of files.</li>
    <li>The App is not intended for emergency or safety-critical use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Cloud Providers & Custom Connections</h2>
  <p>Pro users may connect third-party services (for example: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) using official OAuth flows, or add custom providers by entering a service URL and API key. Connections are read-only; the App does not upload, edit, or delete files on third-party services.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access tokens and credentials are stored on-device and may sync via iCloud Keychain if you enable that option.</li>
    <li>Third-party services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies; the developer is not responsible for their availability, security, or content.</li>
    <li>Support for custom providers depends on local capability checks; unsupported hosts cannot be added.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="section-note">You must comply with any applicable third-party terms (for example, your cloud provider’s terms or your wireless/data service agreement) when using those services with Abookio.</p>

  <h2>12. Metadata & Public Sources</h2>
  <p>The App may retrieve publicly available metadata (such as titles or authors) from public APIs (for example Google Books API or Apple’s iTunes Search API) to help organize your library. The App does not submit personal data with these requests except as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>13. Barcode Scanning</h2>
  <p>You may add books by scanning a barcode using your device camera. Camera input is processed on-device and is not stored by the developer. Scanned values may be used to fetch public metadata from third-party services.</p>

  <h2>14. Apple Intelligence (On-Device)</h2>
  <p>Optional Apple Intelligence features may analyze audiobook descriptions on-device to extract organizational details (for example, primary location or sorting keywords). Analyses are performed locally; results do not leave your device unless you choose to sync them via iCloud.</p>

  <h2>15. iCloud Sync</h2>
  <p>If you enable iCloud sync, certain metadata (such as playback progress, bookmarks, and notes) may sync via Apple’s iCloud/CloudKit and iCloud Keychain in accordance with Apple’s terms. The developer cannot access iCloud-stored user content.</p>

  <h2>16. Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Abookio Pro and other in-app purchases are offered via Apple’s in-app purchase system. Billing, renewals, cancellations, refunds, and trial management are handled by Apple under the App Store terms. Subscription information (title, length, and price) is displayed within the App where purchases are made. Your financial relationship for purchases is with Apple, not the developer.</p>

  <h2>17. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use the App to infringe copyrights or other rights.</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to access accounts or content you do not own or have rights to.</li>
    <li>Do not misuse integrations, automate excessive requests, or share credentials. Abuse may result in rate limits, feature restrictions, or account revocation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>18. Third-Party Services, APIs & Changes</h2>
  <p>Third-party services and APIs used by the App may change, degrade, or become unavailable at any time. The developer is not responsible for loss of functionality, access, or data resulting from changes, outages, or policy updates by third parties.</p>

  <h2>19. Data Preservation & Backups</h2>
  <p>The App does not guarantee preservation or integrity of metadata, bookmarks, progress, collections, or other user data. You are responsible for keeping backups of important data.</p>

  <h2>20. Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is designed to minimize data collection. For details about what data is collected, how it is used, and your rights, see our <a href="https://abookio.app/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>

  <h2>21. Export Control & Sanctions</h2>
  <p>You represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or person subject to U.S. Government embargoes or on any U.S. Government restricted parties list.</p>

  <h2>22. Suspension & Termination</h2>
  <p>The developer may suspend or terminate your access to the App or particular features at any time for security, legal compliance, or material breach of these Terms. Upon termination, your license to use the App ends and you must cease using the App.</p>

  <h2>23. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>

  <h2>24. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, REVENUE, OR OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE DEVELOPER’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU FOR THE APP OR PRO FEATURES IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

  <h2>25. Copyright Inquiries / Takedown</h2>
  <p>For copyright concerns or takedown requests, contact: <a href="mailto:support@abookio.com">support@abookio.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>26. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Germany, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. Mandatory consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction may also apply. In case of any discrepancy between translations, the German version shall prevail.</p>

  <h2>27. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>The developer may update these Terms from time to time. Changes become effective upon posting on the App's website or within the App. Your continued use of the App after posting constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>28. Severability & Survival</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Provisions regarding ownership, disclaimers, limitations of liability, acceptable use, and export compliance survive termination.</p>

  <h2>29. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms, together with the <a href="https://abookio.app/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire agreement between you and the developer regarding the App and supersede prior agreements.</p>
